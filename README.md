# Joint Savings Smart Contract

## Summary Overview

In this project, we write a **smart contract** in **Solidity** for a joint savings account.  This smart contract will create a single balance account, yet it will also be able to distribute the balance to two separate accounts.  You are able to deposit ether into the main account, and then transfer the funds from the main account into any of the two joint accounts.

To see the results of running the code, please see the images found in the **Execution_Results** folder.

## Running the Code

The text file called **joint_savings_contract.sol.txt** is a Notepad file containing the actual Solidity code to run in Remix IDE.
To run this file, create a new file in Remix IDE, and then copy and paste the Solidity code in the text file to the new Solidity file you created.
